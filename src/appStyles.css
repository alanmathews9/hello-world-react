.error{
    color: red;

/*this is normal css file and it is called in app.js
and we have also added a line in inline.js which is commented out
refer inline.js
so when we uncomment it what happens is the code is as expected because
when we dont use css modules the css file can be accessed to the parent component app.js
and also the child component like inline.js 
just by using its classname, this may leasd to css conflicts 
hence we use css modules
refer appStyles.modules.css*/
