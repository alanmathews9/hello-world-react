/*
read the comments under appStyle.css if you havent
this is a module file and here the file is imported to app.js
and it runs on parent component properly, however if we copy the code to a child component 
it causes an error cuz when we use modules it is not accessed globally to all child files
this advanthage helps remove css conflicts
also not since it is css modules the it is imported into app.js differently that a normal css file
